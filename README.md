## Acknowlegments

-   This plugin is obviously inspired by [cooklang-obsidian](https://github.com/cooklang/cooklang-obsidian) by [deathau](https://github.com/deathau). I wanted to learn how to code for Obsidian and add multi-language capabilities to the cooklang plugin.

-   The plugin is using cooklang-ts, which passes all the tests and seems better than the other javascript alternatives.
